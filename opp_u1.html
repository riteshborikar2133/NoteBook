            <br>
            <strong>&#9830; Simple : <br></strong>
            Java is very easy to learn, and its syntax is simple, clean and easy to understand. According to Sun
            Microsystem, Java language is a simple programming language because:
        <ul class="pt">
            <li>
                Java syntax is based on C++ (so easier for programmers to learn it after C++).
            </li>
            <li>
                Java has removed many complicated and rarely-used features, for example, explicitpointers, operator
                overloading, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is no need to remove unreferenced objects because there is an Automatic
                Garbage Collection in Java
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br> <br>
        <strong>&#9830; Object-oriented <br></strong>
        Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is an object.
        Object-oriented means we organize our software as a combination of different types
        of objects that incorporate both data and behavior.
        Object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a methodology that simplifies software
        development and maintenance by providing some rules.
        <br> Basic concepts of OOPs are: <br>
        <ul class="pt">
            <li>
                Object
            </li>
            <li>
                Class
            </li>
            <li>
                Inheritance
            </li>
            <li>
                Polymorphism
            </li>
            <li>
                Abstraction
            </li>
            <li>
                Encapsulation
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&#9830; Architecture-neutral <br></strong>
            Java is architecture neutral because there are no implementation dependent features,
            for example, the size of primitive types is fixed. <br>
            In C programming, int data type occupies 2 bytes of memory for 32-bit architecture
            and 4 bytes of memory for 64-bit architecture. However, it occupies 4 bytes of memory
            for both 32 and 64-bit architectures in Java.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>&#9830 Portable</strong>
            Java is portable because it facilitates you to carry the Java bytecode to any platform. It
            doesn't require any implementation.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>
                &#9830; High-performance
            </strong> <br>
            Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java
            bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language
            (e.g., C++). Java is an interpreted language that is why it is slower than compiled
            languages, e.g., C, C++, etc.

        <h3>Topic 2:- <span class="headspan">Concept of OPPs</span></h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Object means a real-world entity such as a pen, chair, table, computer, watch, etc. Object-Oriented
            Programming is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects. It simplifies
            software development and maintenance by providing some concepts: <br>
            1. Object <br>
            2. Class <br>
            3. Inheritance <br>
            4. Polymorphism <br>
            5. Absstraction <br>
            6. Encapsulation <br>
            <br>
            <strong>&#9830; Object : <br></strong>
            Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object. For example, a chair, pen, table, keyboard,
            bike, etc. It can be physical or logical.
            <br>
            An Object can be defined as an instance of a class. An object contains an address and takes up some space in
            memory. Objects can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code. The only necessary
            thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>&#9830; Class <br></strong>
            Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity.
            <br>
            A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object. Class doesn't
            consume any space.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>&#9830; Inheritance <br></strong>
            Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent
            object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
            <br>
            The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes.
            When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you
            can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

            Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>&#9830 Polymorphism </strong> <br>
            Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is
            derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So
            polymorphism means many forms.
            <br>
            There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can
            perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
            <br>
            If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. Here, we will focus
            on runtime polymorphism in java.
            <br> <br>
            <strong>
                &#9830; Abstraction
            </strong> <br>
            Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
            <br>
            Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details, for example, sending
            SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message
            delivery.
            <br>
            Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it.
            Ways to achieve Abstraction
            <br>
            There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
            <br>
        <ul class="pt">
            <li>
                Abstract class (0 to 100%)
            </li>
            <li>
                Interface (100%)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&#9830; Encapsulation</strong> <br>
            Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsulation. For example, a
            capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines. <br>
            A java class is the example of encapsulation. Java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data
            members are private here.

        <h3>Topic 3:- <span class="headspan">Method in Java</span></h3> <br>
        <p>
            In general, a method is a way to perform some task. Similarly, the method in Java is a collection of
            instructions that performs a specific task. It provides the reusability of code. We can also easily modify
            code using methods. In this section, we will learn what is a method in Java, types of methods, method
            declaration, and how to call a method in Java.

        <h3>Topic 3:- <span class="headspan">Polymorphism</span></h3> <br>
        <p>
            Polymorphism in Java is a concept by which we can perform a single action in different ways. Polymorphism is
            derived from 2 Greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. So

            <br>
            There are two types of polymorphism in Java: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. We can
            perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.
            <br>
            If you overload a static method in Java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. Here, we will focus
            on runtime polymorphism in java.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>&#9830; Runtime Polymorphism in Java</strong> <br>
            Runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Method Dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is
            resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.
            <br>
            In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass. The
            determination of the method to be called is based on the object being referred to by the reference variable.
            <br> <br>
            Example of Java Runtime Polymorphism
            <br>
            In this example, we are creating two classes Bike and Splendor. Splendor class extends Bike class and
            overrides its run() method. We are calling the run method by the reference variable of Parent class. Since
            it refers to the subclass object and subclass method overrides the Parent class method, the subclass method
            is invoked at runtime.
            <br>
            Since method invocation is determined by the JVM not compiler, it is known as runtime polymorphism. <br>
            <br>
            <u>
                Code for Runtime Polymorphism

    void run(){

    }  
    }  
    class Splendor extends Bike{  
    void run(){
        System.out.println
        ("running safely with 60km");
    }  
                    
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    Bike b = new Splendor();//upcasting  
    b.run();  
    }  
    }                  
            </pre>
        <u>Output:</u> <br>Enter the number: 12 <br>
        12 is even
        </p>
        <br>

                &#9830; Compile-time Polymorphism
            </strong> <br>
            Compile-time Polymorphism is also known as Method overloading
            <br>
            If a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters, it is known as Method
            Overloading.
            <br>
            If we have to perform only one operation, having same name of the methods increases the readability of the
            program.
            <br>
            Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any number of arguments, if you
            write the method such as a(int,int) for two parameters, and b(int,int,int) for three parameters then it may
            be difficult for you as well as other programmers to understand the behavior of the method because its name
            differs. <br>
            Different ways to overload the method:
            <br>
            There are two ways to overload the method in java
            <br>
            1.By changing number of arguments <br>
            2.By changing the data type
            <br> <br>
            <u>Method Overloading: changing no. of arguments</u> <br>

        <br>
        <p>
            In Java, a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class
            is
            created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
            <br>
            It is a special type of method which is used to initialize the object.
            <br>
            Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.
            <br>
            It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class. In such case, Java
            compiler
            provides a default constructor by default.
            <br>
            Types of Java constructors
            <br>
            There are two types of constructors in Java:
            <br>
            1.Default constructor (no-arg constructor)
            <br>
            2.Parameterized constructor
            <br> <br>
            <u>Example of default constructor</u> <br>
        <pre class="code">
    /*Java Program to create and call a default
     constructor*/  
    class Bike1{  
    //creating a default constructor  
    Bike1(){
        System.out.println("Bike is created");
    //main method  
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    //calling a default constructor  
    Bike1 b=new Bike1();  
    }  
    }  
            </pre>
        <u>Output</u><br>
        Bike is created
        <br> <br>
        <u>
            Example of default constructor that displays the default values <br>
        </u>
        <pre class="code">
    //Let us see another example of 
    //default constructor  
    //which displays the default values  
    class Student3{  
    int id;  
    String name;  
    //method to display the value of id and name  
    void display(){

    }  
      
    public static void main(String args[]){  
    //creating objects  
    Student3 s1=new Student3();  
    Student3 s2=new Student3();  
    //displaying values of the object  
    s1.display();  
    s2.display();  
    }  
    }  
             </pre>
